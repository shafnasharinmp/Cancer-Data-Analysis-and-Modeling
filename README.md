## Projects
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Analysis]
- [Cervical Cancer Analysis]

## Overview
This repository contains projects focused on the analysis and modeling of healthcare datasets, specifically:
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**: Combining diagnostic and prognostic data to perform feature engineering, neural network modeling, and evaluation.
- **Cervical Cancer Dataset**: Analyzing risk factors using feature engineering, model evaluation, and custom validation functions.

Each project aims to demonstrate advanced data processing, feature engineering, machine learning model building, and evaluation techniques using Python.
